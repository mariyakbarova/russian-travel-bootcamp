      <p class="intro__text">According to VCIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
        but only 36% plan to vacation in their home country. What haven't we seen here at home? The truth is,
        Russia - is a whole universe, with the gentle sea of the south, the thick forests of the Sayan Mountains and the rugged ice of the Putorana. And you can also see
        all these beauties without millions in the account, an international passport or long flights. As, for example, Vera.
        Bashmakova is a brave young mother who took her three children in an armful and put them in her Lada
        and drove 20,000 kilometers across her native country. We have chosen and described some interesting places worthy of
        your vacation.</p>

            the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains.
